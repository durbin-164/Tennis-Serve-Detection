# Tennis-Serve-Detection

The goal of this project is to provide a tool for tennis 
enthusiasts, coaches, and analysts to automatically extract 
and analyze individual serve points from tennis match videos. 
This can be particularly useful for performance analysis, player
improvement, and match statistics.


# Algorithm Overview
The system employs a computer vision algorithm to identify serve points in tennis match videos. The key steps include:

1. Video preprocessing to enhance the features relevant to serve points.
2. Frame-by-frame analysis to detect player serves based on motion.
